# Cross-Section-Tool

Geologic cross sections are vital to improve the geologic understanding of any area. The Florida Geological Survey has been manually creating cross sections in autocad for some time, but my supervisor Michelle Ladle is looking to have the survey move to a more automated way of making them that does not require expertise in a paid program like autocad.

This is still a big work in progress and has a long way to go.
